Meta-analysis of snail body size change
-----------------------------------------

### Next steps

1. compare rate of change in had vs hopkins sst data
   - compare time series and 10-yr periods
   
2. try using the raw hms data for comparison
   - noticed that had and hms agree for modern period, but not for historic

### Elahi 2015

* Chlorostoma funebralis

* Littorina keenae

* Lottia digitalis

### Roy 2003

Compared average shell length of snails from museum specimens to present-day intertidal collections

Focused on maximum body size

* Acanthinucella spirata
    - 1925-1965-2000: 23-29mm; size cut-off was 20mm
    
* Fissurela volcano
    - 1905-1965-2000: 21-26mm; size cut-off was 20mm

* Lottia gigantea
    - 1905-2000: 56-75mm; size cut-off was 50mm

* Tegula aureotincta
    - 1925-1965-2000: 23-29mm; size cut-off was 20mm


### Fisher 2009

Compared average shell length of Nucella lapillus from museum specimens to present-day intertidal collections

* Nucella lapillus
    - 1915-1922: 19-28 mm
    - 2007: 20-35 mm
    - "we cannot be sure that he collected snails from the smallest of size classes...Small N. lapillus snails (less than 15mm) seek refuge in rock crevices; Colton may have overlooked these snails"
