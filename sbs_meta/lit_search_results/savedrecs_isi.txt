AB The role of antagonistic organismal interactions in the production of
   long-term macroevolutionary trends has been debated for decades. Some
   evidence seems to suggest that temporal trends in predation frequency
   share a common causative mechanism with genus-level diversity, whereas
   studies on the role of parasites in "shaping" the evolutionary process
   are rare indeed. Digenean trematodes (Phylum Platyhelminthes) infest
   molluscs in at least one stage of their complex life cycle. Trematodes
   leave characteristic oval-shaped pits with raised rims on the interior
   of their bivalve hosts, and these pits are preserved in the fossil
   record. Here we survey 11,785 valves from the Pleistocene-Holocene
   deposits of the Po Plain and from nearby modern coastal environments on
   the northeast Adriatic coast of Italy. Of these, 205 valves exhibited
   trematode-induced pits. Trematodes were selective parasites in terms of
   host taxonomy and host body size. Infestation was restricted to lower
   shoreface/transition-to-platform paleoenvironments. During the Holocene,
   individuals from the transgressive systems tract were significantly more
   likely to be infested than those from highstand systems tracts. Temporal
   trends in infestation frequency cannot be explained as an
   ecological/evolutionary phenomenon (e.g., the hypothesis of escalation);
   instead the trend seems controlled by environmental variation induced by
   glacio-eustatic sea-level changes and inadequate sampling. Because this
   interaction appears to be ephemeral, both temporally and spatially, it
   is not likely that any selective pressure would be continuous over
   geologic time in this region. Furthermore, these results support the
   hypothesis that antagonistic interactions are lower in the northern
   Adriatic Sea in comparison to other midlatitude shallow marine settings.

AB The importance of large breeding individuals for maintaining the health
   of marine fish and invertebrate populations has long been recognized.
   Unfortunately, decades of human harvesting that preferentially remove
   larger individuals have led to drastic reductions in body sizes of many
   of these species. Such size-selective harvesting is particularly
   worrisome for sequentially hermaphroditic species where the larger size
   classes are composed primarily of one sex. Whether these species can
   maintain stable sex ratios under sustained harvesting pressure depends
   on the level of plasticity of their life-history traits. Here, we show
   that populations of a marine limpet (Lottia gigantea) can adjust a
   fundamental aspect of their life history (the timing of sex change) when
   subjected to size-selective harvesting. As predicted by theoretical
   models, individuals from harvested populations change sex at smaller
   sizes and grow at slower rates compared to individuals from protected
   populations. In addition, the relative size at which the change from
   male to female occurs remains constant (similar to 0.75; size at sex
   change/maximum size) across populations, regardless of harvesting
   pressure. Our results show that population-level demographic and
   life-history data, in conjunction with existing theory, can be
   sufficient to predict the responses of sequential hermaphrodites to
   harvesting pressure. Furthermore, they suggest such species can
   potentially adapt to size-selective harvesting.

AB Anthropogenic impacts have led to widespread extinctions of species on
   oceanic islands but the nature of many of these extinctions remains
   poorly known. Here we investigate extinction selectivities of
   terrestrial gastropods from the Ogasawara archipelago in the northwest
   Pacific, where anthropogenic threats have changed over time, shifting
   primarily from the effects of habitat loss to predation by a variety of
   different predators. Across all of the islands, extinct species had
   significantly smaller geographic ranges compared with species that are
   still alive, but among the surviving species, ranges of those that are
   currently declining due to human impacts do not differ significantly
   from those that are not threatened. Extinctions were selective with
   respect to spire index (SI) of shells, a trait of potential functional
   importance, but the relationship between body size and extinction
   vulnerability varied among extinction agents, some of which were
   strongly size selective, whereas others were not. Overall, whereas
   anthropogenic impacts have resulted in nonrandom losses of phenotypic
   diversity, the patterns of selectivity are complex, vary among islands,
   and with the type of threat. As extinction agents have changed
   historically, so has the pattern of loss. Because of the changing nature
   of anthropogenic impacts, resiliency to one type of threat does not
   guarantee long-term survival of species and future patterns of
   biodiversity loss on these islands are likely to be different from those
   in the past.

AB The Lake Simcoe ecosystem has been subjected to multiple stressors
   during the past century, including changes in nutrient loads and the
   introduction of non-native species. To evaluate the effects of these
   changes on the Lake Simcoe offshore benthic community, we collected
   benthic samples in 2008 at sites allowing statistical comparisons with
   detailed surveys in 1983 and qualitative comparisons with others
   focussing more on nearshore collections in 2005 and 1926. Total
   abundance of benthic invertebrates declined significantly from 1983 to
   2008, and correspondence analyses revealed major changes in community
   composition. Typical of the overall pattern, three of the major benthic
   taxa (Nematoda, Oligochaeta and Ostracoda) declined from 1983 to 2008,
   particularly at depths greater than 10 m. Chironomids showed little
   change in abundance from 1983 to 2008 but their biomass increased
   because body length nearly doubled during this period. Oligochaete
   abundance declined but biomass remained the same due to increases in
   body length from 1983 to 2008. Ostracod abundance and biomass both
   declined because body size distributions did not change from 1983 to
   2008. In contrast to total invertebrate abundance, that of dreissenid
   mussels, amphipods, isopods, gastropods and sphaeriids increased and
   these taxa also occupied greater depths (up to 30 m) in 2008 compared
   with historical surveys. Our results suggest a strong effect of both
   water quality changes and dreissenid establishment in shaping the
   contemporary Lake Simcoe benthic invertebrate community. (C) 2010

AB Small abalone Haliotis diversicolor (Reeve, 1846) is one of the smallest
   commercial abalone in the world. The successful application of
   artificial propagation and mass seed production techniques since the
   1980s have resulted in the establishment of well-developed culture
   systems for small abalone in Taiwan. In the study reported here, we
   estimated the growth of a population of small abalone after a decade in
   a closed culture system and its growth characteristics with those of
   wild populations reported in previous studies. The von Bertalanffy
   growth equations of the shell length (L) and body weight (W) of cultured
   abalone were L (t) = 71.73 (1 - e(-0.84 (t-0.16))) and W (t) = 47.70 (1
   - e(-0.84 (t-0.16)))(3.180), respectively. The instantaneous rate of
   change for weight had an inflection point at the age of 1.54 years,
   indicating that cultured abalones reach their apex of body growth around
   this age. Compared with the wild populations, the cultured population
   exhibits a significantly smaller maximal shell length (L (a)) and a
   significantly larger growth coefficient (k). Based on our results, it
   appears that the artificial culture of generations of small albalone for
   one decade or more in a closed system could be one of the major factors
   causing the observed minimization of size in the cultured abalone; this
   may be an adaptation in which growth is traded off for the larger k.

AB Distribution of the indigenous clam Pisidium costulosum Connolly 1931
   (Bivalvia:Sphaeriidae) in relation to temperature, rainfall and
   watertype in South AfricaLittle is known of the junctional role of
   freshwater bivalves and particularly the ecology of burrowing species
   has been inadequately studied. This is an unfortunate situation in view
   of the fact that freshwater biotopes are losing biodiversily at an
   alarming rate. The genus Pisidium includes some of the tiniest bivalve
   species known to man, it has a worldwide distribution and its origin is
   considered to be Mesozoic. Due to the fact that Pisidium can exploit
   virtually almost any freshwater habitat, that it is a bottom dweller and
   filter feeder and is also relatively long lived, it is important to
   study species of this genus because they could be used for monitoring
   environmental conditions. This article focuses on the geographical
   distribution and habitats Of P. costulosum, a species considered to be
   endemic to South Africa and which is the most widespread of the six
   Pisidium species on record for this country in the database of the
   National Freshwater Snail Collection (NFSC).Details pertaining to the
   habitats of the 428 samples of P. costulosum as recorded at the time of
   collection were extracted from the database of the NFSC. The 187 loci
   (1/16 th square degrees) in which the 428 collection sites were located,
   were distributed in pre-selected intervals of mean annual air
   temperature and rainfall, as well as intervals of mean altitude, to
   illustrate the frequency of occurrence within specific intervals. A
   temperature index was calculated for all mollusc species in the database
   from their frequencies of occurrence within the selected intervals and
   the results used to rank them in order of their association with low to
   high climatic temperatures. To evaluate the significance of the
   difference between frequencies of occurrence in, on, or at the various
   options for each parameter investigated, chi-square values were
   calculated. In addition an effect size value was calculated to determine
   the contribution of each parameter towards establishing the geographical
   distribution of this species based on the data in the database. A
   multivariate analysis in the form of a decision tree was also
   constructed from the data which enabled the selection and ranking of
   those variables that maximally discriminated between the frequency of
   occurrence of P. costulosum in, on, or at the various options for each
   parameter as compared to all other bivalve species in the database.Our
   records show that this species is well represented in Gauteng and the
   central and southern areas of Mpumalanga. It is relatively continuously
   spread through the north eastern parts of the Free State and all along
   its eastern and southern borders, sparsely distributed in the Northern
   Cape and poorly represented in Limpopo.Although it was reported from 13
   of the 14 water-bodies represented in the database, more than 60% of the
   samples were recovered from streams and rivers and from water conditions
   described as perennial, standing, clear and fresh and more than 45% came
   from habitats with a predominantly muddy substratum.From the effect size
   values calculated for the various parameters it can be deduced that type
   of water-body, temperature and altitude played the most significant role
   in establishing the geographical distribution of this species in South
   Africa.On account of the fact that country-wide surveys by government
   and local health authorities were discontinued in the early 1980 the
   current range of the geographical distribution of freshwater mollusc
   species in South Africa is rather uncertain. The data in the database
   were compiled over a period of approximately five decades and due to the
   fact that the majority of sampling sites have not been revisited since,
   little is known of the conservation status of the freshwater molluscs of
   South Africa. Its close association with cooler climatic conditions as
   indicated by its temperature index and its dependency on perennial
   habitats, suggest that P. costulosum could be vulnerable to climatic
   changes due to global warming and that this could have a negative impact
   on the range of its geographical distribution. It is suggested that
   efforts should be made to update the geographical distribution of at
   least those mollusc species that are of medical and veterinary
   importance and at the same time to monitor the progress of exotic
   mollusc species in their invasion of water-bodies in this country. A
   comparison of the results of such surveys with the long range of data in
   the NFSC database could be valuable to assess the current conservation
   status of at least some of the indigenous freshwater molluscs of this
   country.

AB The monkey goby (Neogobius fluviatilis) is one of the Ponto-Caspian
   species that in recent decades made substantial East-to-West invasions
   in European inland waters. Now the species is present in the Danube as
   far as its Slovakian section. In the last decade the species also
   invaded the Western Bug and Vistula rivers, in the latter it is numerous
   nearly as far as its delta. The purpose of our study was to define the
   diet spectrum, feeding preferences, spatial and size related changes in
   diet and diurnal feeding activity of this goby. Another goal was to
   predict which groups of native prey would be most affected by the
   presence of this exotic predator in newly invaded areas. The study was
   carried out at three sampling locations in the Vistula River system. The
   food spectrum of the monkey goby was broad. The fish consumed insect
   larvae and pupae, crustaceans, annelids, gastropods and fish. Chironomid
   larvae were a prevalent food category in all sampling sites, followed by
   amphipod crustaceans at one site and by trichopteran larvae and
   chironomid pupae at another. At the third site, there was no distinct
   subdominant food category. According to the values of the Ivlev's
   selectivity index, the preferred food category were chironomid larvae.
   No significant differences in diet were found over the 24-h cycle. There
   was no variation among different fish size groups. From our studies and
   from the available literature data it can be concluded that the species,
   due to its ability to use locally available food resources, displays a
   generalistic and highly flexible feeding strategy.

   Ocean, shorter and thicker shells have been reported for several species
   following the introduction of predatory Carcinus maenas crabs early in
   the 20th century. But we report that the shell lengths of Nucella
   lapillus actually increased by an average of 22.6% over the past
   century, with no evidence of shell thickening after correcting for shell
   length. The increases in shell length were greatest on sheltered shores,
   highlighting the interaction between wave exposure and the sampling
   period. Comparisons were based on archived shells collected in 1915-1922
   from sites that were resampled in 2007. N. lapillus is an important
   member of North Atlantic marine ecosystems, and our results suggest that
   the impacts of historical changes in species' key morphological traits

AB Since 1999, NOAA's Biogeography Branch of the Center for Coastal
   Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA-BB) has been working with federal and
   territorial partners to characterize, monitor, and assess the status of
   the marine environment around northeastern St. Croix, U.S. Virgin
   Islands. This effort is part of the broader NOAA Coral Reef Conservation
   Program's (CRCP) National Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring Program
   (NCREMP). With support from CRCP's NCREMP, CCMA conducts the "Caribbean
   Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring project" (CREM) with goals to: (1)
   spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size
   of marine fauna associated with shallow water coral reef seascapes
   (mosaics of coral reefs, seagrasses, sand and mangroves); (2) relate
   this information to in situ ine-scale habitat data and the spatial
   distribution and diversity of habitat types using benthic habitat maps;
   (3) use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for
   enacting management decisions in a spatial setting; (4) establish the
   eficacy of those management decisions; and (5) develop data collection
   and data management protocols. The monitoring effort in northeastern St.
   Croix was conducted through partnerships with the National Park Service
   (NPS) and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural
   Resources (VI-DPNR). The geographical focal point of the research is
   Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a protected area originally
   established in 1961 and greatly expanded in 2001; however, the work also
   encompassed a large portion of the recently created St. Croix East End
   Marine Park (EEMP). Project funding is primarily provided by NOAA CRCP,
   CCMA and NPS. In recent decades, scientiic and non-scientiic
   observations have indicated that the structure and function of the coral
   reef ecosystem around northeastern St. Croix have been adversely
   impacted by a wide range of environmental stressors. The major stressors
   have included the mass Diadema die off in the early 1980s, a series of
   hurricanes beginning with Hurricane Hugo in 1989, overishing, mass
   mortality of Acropora corals due to disease and several coral bleaching
   events, with the most severe mass bleaching episode in 2005. The area is
   also an important recreational resource supporting boating, snorkeling,
   diving and other water based activities. With so many potential threats
   to the marine ecosystem and a dramatic change in management strategy in
   2003 when the park's Interim Regulations (Presidential Proclamation No.
   7392) established BIRNM as one of the irst fully protected marine areas
   in NPS system, it became critical to identify existing marine fauna and
   their spatial distributions and temporal dynamics. This provides
   ecologically meaningful data to assess ecosystem condition, support
   decision making in spatial planning (including the evaluation of eficacy
   of current management strategies) and determine future information
   needs. The ultimate goal of the work is to better understand the coral
   reef ecosystems and to provide information toward protecting and
   enhancing coral reef ecosystems for the beneit of the system itself and
   to sustain the many goods and services that it offers society. This
   Technical Memorandum contains analysis of the first six years of fish
   survey data (2001-2006) and associated characterization of the benthos
   (1999-2006). The primary objectives were to quantify changes in ish
   species and assemblage diversity, abundance, biomass and size structure
   and to provide spatially explicit information on the distribution of key
   species or groups of species and to compare community structure inside
   (protected) versus outside (ished) areas of BIRNM. Methods: For each
   biannual survey mission, selection of sample sites occurred via a
   stratiied random design (2001-2006) using hard and soft bottom habitat
   types delineated in NOAA's benthic habitat map (Menza et al., 2006). In
   2003, after implementation of the park's Interim Regulations, sampling
   was also stratiied by whether or not the site was located inside or
   outside BIRNM to evaluate effect of the ishing closure (only 2003 to
   2006). Fish were surveyed during daylight hours along 25 m long by 4 m
   wide belt-transects for a ixed duration of 15 minutes. All species
   observed were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and
   their abundance was counted and grouped by size class. To quantify
   benthic habitat, ive 1 m2 quadrats were randomly placed on the transect
   and used to examine the relatively fine-scale biotic and abiotic
   components of the seascape (e.g., coral cover, macroalgal cover, etc.).
   In addition, Geographical Information System (GIS) tools were used to
   quantify the seascape surrounding each transect using habitat
   distributions represented in NOAA's benthic habitat maps (e.g., amount
   of seagrass, number of habitat types, etc.). Comparative analyses of
   biotic components inside versus outside BIRNM were conducted using a
   wide range of ish variables representing community, trophic, family and
   individual species level data incorporating measures of abundance,
   biomass and diversity. A total of 884 transects collected between 2003
   and 2006 inclusively were used to examine differences in ish metrics
   inside versus outside BIRNM. Benthic comparisons used 716 benthic
   surveys on hardbottom habitat types conducted between 2001 and 2006.
   Abundance maps were used to examine species distributions for both
   juveniles and adults and interpolations of point data were used to
   examine broad-scale spatial patterns of ish and benthic habitat
   variables. Major indings: Diversity hotspots [center dot] Despite heavy
   impacts from disease, bleaching and hurricanes, the area around the
   eastern tip of Buck Island remains ecologically distinctive having some
   of the highest live coral cover and rugosity in the mapped region, also
   with high calcareous coralline algal cover, high ish species richness,
   biomass of herbivorous ish and high abundance for many common ish
   species.[center dot] The linear reef (i.e., barrier reefs) and adjacent
   colonized pavement that extends east-west from Teague Bay to Coakley Bay
   and now falls within the EEMP "no-take zone" and "recreation zone" was
   found to support high coral species richness and fish species richness.
   [center dot] Extensive areas with high coral species richness, high live
   coral cover for Montastraea cavernosa and M. annularis, high ish species
   richness and high abundance for several ish species including coney
   (Cephalopholis fulva), rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolor) and queen
   triggerish (Balistes vetula) occurred along the northernmost edge of the
   benthic habitat map. This indicates that important deeper water habitat
   is likely to exist beyond the scope of this report, requiring further
   benthic habitat mapping effort combined with visual census
   (diver/remotely operated vehicle [ROV]) to capture data on ish
   communities (see Foster Mission web site:
   http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/products/biogeography/ usvi_nps/overview.htm).
   [center dot] Many of the coral reefs with highest ish species richness
   were within 200 m of seagrass beds. Several other studies have
   demonstrated links between ish distribution on coral reefs and proximity
   to seagrass beds suggesting that many species may beneit from
   complementary resources provided by seagrasses in close proximity to
   coral reefs. This highlights the importance of considering mosaics of
   habitat types in resource management decision making. Benthic habitat
   [center dot] The benthic environment inside BIRNM was signiicantly
   different to the outside for 75% of ine-scale variables quantiied within
   1 m2 quadrates and 78% of seascape variables quantiied within 100 m2
   radius seascape units surrounding each transect. [center dot]
   Seventy-eight percent of the mapped area inside BIRNM was hardbottom
   habitat dominated by colonized pavement and 22% was softbottom (sand and
   seagrasses); outside BIRNM, 46% was hardbottom and 54% softbottom.
   Seascapes inside BIRNM also had signiicantly higher mean habitat
   richness. [center dot] Coral cover for all major scleractinian (hard
   coral) families was signiicantly higher inside BIRNM and coral reefs had
   a signiicantly higher ratio of live coral cover to macroalgal cover than
   outside BIRNM. [center dot] Overall, hardbottom habitats of the study
   area were dominated by turf algae (37%) and macroalgae (11.4%), with
   mean scleractinian coral cover of only 5.6% ranging from 12.1% on patch
   reefs to 2% on the less rugose reef rubble. [center dot] Across years
   (2003-2006), macroalgal cover showed some indication of decline both
   inside and outside BIRNM. [center dot] Filamentous
   cyanobacteria/macroalgal blooms were detected in the fall sampling
   period with mean cover as high as 18% in October 2005; a year with
   anomalously high summer water temperatures that also resulted in a mass
   coral bleaching event. [center dot] Peaks in mean algal turf cover
   (50-60%) were detected in the spring (2006) season following the mass
   coral bleaching event and mean live coral cover approximately one year
   after the event was the lowest since this study commenced. Fish [center

   families. Nine of the 10 most frequently encountered species belonged to
   the families Labridae (wrasse), Acanthuridae (surgeonish) and Scaridae
   (parrotish). [center dot] The majority of the most abundant ish across
   the study region were found in highest densities over hardbottom habitat
   types, yet most also utilized multiple habitat types including
   seagrasses and sand. [center dot] Fish metrics signiicantly higher on

   fulva) exhibited distinct patterns in spatial distributions, with high
   coney density mostly over the contiguous colonized hardbottom areas
   (much of which is inside BIRNM) and high densities of red hind found
   mostly to the south of Buck Island (many outside BIRNM). [center dot]
   Very few of the largest (>35 cm) and very few of the smallest (<5 cm)
   size classes were observed for groupers (Serranidae) and snappers.
   Groupers and snappers in the largest size class (>35 cm) were recorded
   at <1% and 3%, of survey sites, respectively. [center dot] Body lengths
   of the largest individuals of several common groupers, snappers and
   grunts were less than the maximum size recorded for the species. The
   largest yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) was approximately 70% of
   the maximum known adult size, schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus)
   66%, bluestriped grunt (Haemulon sciurus) 65- 76%, white grunt (H.
   plumierii) 56-66% and red hind (E. guttatus) 60% of known maximum size.
   [center dot] Highest densities of threespot damselish (Stegastes
   planifrons), a potential indicator of healthy reefs with high live coral
   cover, were found around the eastern tip of Buck Island within BIRNM and
   the fringing reef extending east-west along the northeast coast of St.
   Croix.Historic and recent changes in ish populations [center dot]
   Synoptic overview of inter-annual differences inside and outside BIRNM
   showed no consistent decline for any of the 39 ish metrics inside BIRNM,
   but instead showed increases every year between 2003 and 2006 for mean
   ish density (all species combined). Densities in 2005 and 2006 were
   signiicantly higher than 2003. It is not yet clear if this has resulted
   from initiation of NPS Interim Regulations and enforcement patrols.
   [center dot] No such increases were recorded outside BIRNM, instead
   considerable and consecutive inter-annual decline was apparent for grunt
   biomass, especially bluestriped grunt (H. sciurus), and density and
   biomass of stripped parrotish (S. iseri). Densities in 2005 and 2006
   were significantly lower than 2003. [center dot] Only three Nassau
   grouper (Epinephelus striatus), three yellowin grouper (Mycteroperca
   venenosa) and one tiger grouper (M. tigris) were observed in the study
   region over the course of six years of monitoring using 1,275 samples.
   Notably, these three species were completely absent from the Buck Island
   nearshore areas in 2001-2006, but were present in low abundance in 1979.
   These grouper species are highly vulnerable to ishing due to their large
   body size and relatively slow maturity and this historical difference in
   abundance indicates that the grouper have been overished. [center dot]
   In contrast, coney (C. fulva) and red hind (E. guttatus) were more
   abundant around Buck Island between 2001 and 2006 than in 1979. [center
   dot] Threespot damselish (S. planifrons), a potential indicator of
   healthy reefs with high live coral cover, was more abundant around Buck
   Island in 1979 than in the 2001-2006 sampling period. Macroinvertebrates
   [center dot] Long-spined urchin densities (Diadema antillarum) around
   Buck Island have not recovered since the mass mortality in 1983.
   However, this study and the scientiic literature indicate that some
   minor recovery may be occurring in lagoonal and back reef areas along
   the sheltered coastline of northeastern St. Croix. Long-spined urchins
   were once important ecosystem engineers controlling the abundance of
   algae in the region and little is known about the factors (e.g,
   limitations to recruitment) that are controlling population recovery.
   [center dot] Coral reef ecosystems of the study region, particularly the
   large expanse of seagrasses between Buck Island and St. Croix support
   regionally important populations of adult and juvenile queen conch
   (Strombus gigas). This is important since queen conch is an important
   food resource in the Virgin Islands and according to NOAA's Ofice of
   Protected Species, queen conch is declining throughout the species'
   range. Recommendations: Additional mapping, inventory and monitoring
   efforts are required to explore the deeper water ecosystems within the
   BIRNM that exist outside NOAA's current benthic habitat map. In
   addition, acoustic tracking studies may reveal the mechanisms underlying
   some of the observed temporal changes in fish communities and will
   determine connectivity between lagoons and coral reefs offshore.
   Tracking will also provide important information on the time that
   individual ish spend inside and outside the boundaries of protected
   areas. Very little is known about the timing of movements during the
   daily home range, ontogenetic shifts and spawning migrations and spatial
   pathways for such movements for most species. Some targeted surveying
   for specific substrate types may be required to identify the extent of
   suitable settlement habitat for juvenile grouper in the study region or
   whether groupers are instead immigrating into the region from settlement
   habitat outside. Long-term monitoring is necessary to determine the
   magnitude of the apparent declines and to track the trajectory of
   recovery for species that exhibited an increase in density after several
   years of decline. Long-term monitoring effort may also reveal direction
   in the change for the many species that were too highly variable from
   year to year to provide such information over the four years of data
   used. Within the BIRNM-EEMP Marine Protected Area (MPA) complex,
   resource managers and stakeholders should examine the option of closing
   the gap between the southern boundary of BIRNM and the no-take zone of
   EEMP along the northeastern coast of St. Croix. An adjoining of the
   boundaries would incorporate an extensive area of seagrass habitat thus
   ensuring full protection of important complementary resources that
   provide food and habitat for many ish (both resident and transient
   species). These seagrass beds are also regionally important habitat for
   queen conch and may provide important resources for Caribbean spiny
   lobster. Further targeted surveys are required to assess and monitor the
   status of queen conch populations and to determine whether long-spined
   urchins are recovering. Such information will help to determine if
   management intervention is needed to assist recovery of sea urchin
   populations and to evaluate the conch ishery. Additional work to map the
   distribution of juvenile and adult Caribbean spiny lobster populations
   using existing survey data and to determine the factors that explain
   spatial distributions would be very valuable in supporting
   ecosystem-based management of marine resources in the region. Benthic
   habitat maps should be periodically updated due to the dynamic nature of
   coral reef ecosystems. This is particularly important when linking ish
   seascape structure and when assessing seascape change such as
   quantifying gain or loss of major habitat types.

AB Phenotypic plasticity has been the object of considerable interest over
   the past several decades, but in few cases are mechanisms underlying
   plastic responses well understood. For example, it is unclear whether
   predator-induced changes in gastropod shell morphology represent an
   active physiological response or a by-product of reduced feeding. We
   address this question by manipulating feeding and growth of intertidal
   snails, Littorina obtusata, using two approaches: (i) exposure to
   predation cues from green crabs Carcinus maenas and (ii) reduced food
   availability, and quantifying growth in shell length, shell mass, and
   body mass, as well as production of faecal material and shell
   micro-structural characteristics (mineralogy and organic fraction) after
   96 days. We demonstrate that L. obtusata actively increases
   calcification rate in response to predation threat, and that this
   response entails energetic and developmental costs. That this induced
   response is not strictly tied to the animal's behaviour should enhance
   its evolutionary potential.

   Locations close to the northern range edges of a southern trochid

   had extended by up to 55 krn. Populations sampled over a latitudinal
   extent of 4 degrees from northern limits towards the centre of the range
   showed synchronous increases in abundance throughout the years sampled,
   suggesting a large-scale factor such as climate was driving the observed

AB The diet of the Texas map turtle (Graptemys versa) in the Colorado River

   in 1998-1999 and 2) dissection of museum specimens collected in 1949
   prior to invasion of their habitats by exotic Asian clams (Corbicula
   spp.). Feces were found to be better indicators of dietary diversity
   based on log-log comparisons of sample volume with turtle size and the
   fact that Corbicula were absent in stomach flushes of small female
   specimens that yielded abundant shell fragments in their feces. Adult
   males fed most heavily on aquatic insect larvae (primarily trichopterans
   and ephemeropterans) and showed little change in diet over 5 decades.
   Small females that overlapped adult males in body size had wider heads
   and alveolar surfaces of the jaws than did males and fed predominantly
   on Corbicula, snails, insect larvae, and algae. Females that were larger
   than males in body size showed a change from a diverse diet in 1949 that
   included sphaeriid clams, trichopteran larvae, sponges, bryozoans, and
   algae, to nearly exclusive feeding on the invasive mollusk Corbicala 5
   decades later. Based on the present report and previous studies, it
   appears that I result of the invasion of rivers in North America by
   Corbicula is greatly decreased diversity of diet in adult female
   Graptemys of moderate head width (mesocephaly).

TI Classification of the Helicinidae: Review of morphological

AB The present study combines a taxonomical revision of the poorly known
   Costa Rican Helicinidae, with a detailed investigation of certain
   morphological structures with respect to their relevance for
   systematics, culminating in a discussion of the arrangement of the
   Central American mainland species.
   The revision of the Costa Rican species is based on the examination of
   nearly all type material, coupled with extensive field work and
   investigations of the collections of the Instituto Nacional de
   Biodiversidad de Costa Rica and the Florida Museum of Natural History,
   Gainesville, along with perusal of additional historical material. With
   minor exceptions, all these species were investigated with respect to
   the features of shell, operculum, surface sculpture of embryonic shell
   and teleoconch, internal shell structures, radula, and female
   reproductive system. In addition, analyses of morphometry and sexual
   dimorphism were carried out. Faced with a limited amount of material, it
   became necessary to develop a new preparation method to separate the
   soft body from the shell without damaging either.
   For the higher classification and comparative analysis of the different
   morphological characteristics, similar examinations emphasizing formerly
   poorly studied or neglected characteristics, such as embryonic shell and
   female reproductive system, were carried out for 17 additional species
   representing the most important related Central American supraspecific
   taxa using their type species when available. For taxa with inaccessible
   material, data from the available literature were critically
   incorporated.
   For Costa Rica, 15 species were recognized, among them seven new
   species, partially published in Richling (2001) - Helicina echandiensis,
   H. talamancensis, H. monteverdensis, H. chiquitica, H. escondida,
   Alcadia (Microalcadia) hojarasca, and A. (M.) boeckeleri - and two new
   subspecies - H. punctisulcata cuericiensis, and H. beatrix dopejensis.
   Other previously subspecifically separated taxa (H. funcki costaricensis
   Wagner, 1905; H. tenuis pittieri Wagner, 1910) were shown to fall within
   the range of intraspecific variability. Records of the Guatemalan and
   Mexican species Helicina oweniana L. Pfeiffer, 1849, and subspecies, H.
   amoena L. Pfeiffer, 1849, as well as those of H. fragilis Morelet, 1851,
   were proven to be based on faulty identifications and were therefore
   excluded from the Costa Rican fauna. This fact, together with the
   recognition of the several new species, shows that the faunal
   composition of Costa Rica is much more distinct from that of the
   northern areas than previously assumed. The transitional zone of
   Nicaragua, however, still remains widely uninvestigated. Only Helicina
   tenuis L. Pfeiffer, 1849, being ecologically very tolerant, Lucidella
   lirata (L. Pfeiffer, 1847), and Pyrgodomus microdinus (Morelet, 1851)
   are widespread, extending from Mexico to Costa Rica, perhaps even
   farther south. The distribution of the typical Costa Rican species
   follows the topographical subdivision created by the Central
   Cordilleras, along with its corresponding effects on the climate.
   Contrary to former assumptions, certain features of the female
   reproductive system proved very useful for the classification of the
   Helicinidae. For the first time, monaulic conditions have been
   recognized for Helicina and Eutrochatella, necessitating the correction
   of previous descriptions in this respect. Furthermore, the monaulic or
   diaulic state is characteristic of the genera and is paralleled by
   consistent changes in the embryonic shell structure. Because primitive
   members of the Helicinidae possess a diaulic system, the monaulic
   condition is regarded as the derived state. The Central American genera
   Helicina, Alcadia, Eutrochatella, Lucidella and Schasicheila were
   properly distinguished and described by this, as well as by other
   differences in the female reproductive system. The anatomies of the type
   species of Helicina and Alcadia were examined for the first time, and
   earlier descriptions of Eutrochatella and Lucidella were corrected in
   major points. On the basis of this new evidence, the assignment of
   traditional subgeneric units of Helicina and Alcadia, previously based
   mainly on vague radula and shell characteristics, was especially
   reassessed. The subgenera Sericea and Analcadia were transferred to
   Helicina, as well as the mainland land species summarized under the
   preoccupied taxon "Gemma". Tristramia, Oxyrhombus, Pseudoligyra,
   Oligyra, Succincta, "Cinctella" [also preoccupied] and Punctisulcata
   were confirmed in their association with Helicina. Due to its monaulic
   condition, the former genus Ceochasma is reduced to a subgenus of
   Helicina. In addition, exemplary non-type Antillean species were
   studied, including Helicina jamaicensis Sowerby, 1841, which had to be
   shifted to Alcadia s.l., and Alcadia (Analcadia) platychila (von
   Muhlfedt, 1816), which is now assigned to Helicina s.s. On one hand, the
   new arrangement excludes Alcadia as previously known from the Central
   American mainland, but, on the other hand, examination of the newly
   discovered Costa Rican species Helicina hojarasca and H. boeckeleri
   required the establishment of a new subgenus of Alcadia, Microalcadia n.
   subgen. on the mainland, based mainly on the features of the female
   reproductive system and embryonic shell structure. The occurrence of
   Alcadia with only a few diminutive species on the mainland of Central
   America corresponds to the distribution of the genera
   Eutrochatella/Pyrgodomus and Lucidella.
   The Central American mainland species of Helicina seem to show a closer
   relationship among each other than to the northern South American
   subgenera Analcadia and Sericea. The Brazilian taxon Angulata,
   previously a subgroup of Helicina, deviates remarkably in embryonic
   shell structure and shows differences in anatomy that still require
   final confirmation, and it thus deserves recognition as a separate
   genus.
   Contrary to the well-supported differentiation at the generic level, the
   attempt to characterize subgroups of the Central American mainland
   species of Helicina has been only partially successful. Certain
   similarities in teleoconch surface structure, relative development of
   the accessory structures of the female reproductive system, and the
   degree of sexual dimorphism become obvious and are discussed to some
   extent, but intermediate characteristics complicate a satisfactory
   solution. Besides Ceochasma, three Central American mainland subgenera
   are recognized: Oligyra, Tristramia most closely resembling Helicina
   s.s., and "Gemma". The latter preoccupied name is tentatively retained,
   because the proposal of a new name seems inappropriate at this stage.
   Investigation of the morphological features other than the embryonic
   shell sculpture and the female reproductive system revealed the
   following additional results, mainly based on the Costa Rican species of
   Helicina:
   Characteristics of teleoconch, operculum, and radula, previously
   regarded as substantial for classification, were repeatedly demonstrated
   to be subject to convergent development, thus limiting their value for
   systematics. Different examples are given, such as the T-shaped lateral
   of the radula or periostracal hairs, and further evidence is provided by
   the necessary re-arrangements outlined above. Nevertheless, these
   features play a supplementary or supporting role.
   The mantle pigmentation of arboreal Helicinidae is closely related to
   the transparency of the shell and functionally replaces shell color in
   thin shells. The physiological possibility of an obviously adaptable
   mantle pigmentation could provide the opportunity for survival with
   thin, transparent shells as adaptation to the limited availability of
   calcium carbonate. Whereas varying and patterned mantle color are
   characteristic for arboreal thin-shelled species, the color of the head
   and foot is seldom species specific.
   Size differences of the embryonic shell have not previously been studied
   for Helicinidae. Embryonic shell size is shown to increase with the
   shell size within a group of related species and also altitude within
   different populations of a species. Furthermore, it may show a certain
   species specificity. Preliminary data on Lucidella and
   Eutrochatella/Pyrgodomus suggest a consistently smaller embryonic shell
   size than in Helicina or Alcadia.
   Internal shell structures-axial cleft and muscle attachments-seem
   characteristic for certain systematic units, for example, Lucidella and
   Schasicheila. The length of the axial cleft is confirmed to be constant
   within a species, but, contrary to former assumption, it is not related
   to the whorl count.
   The data on sexual dimorphism given in this study represent the most
   comprehensive approach to date to analyze this phenomenon for
   Helicinidae. The sexual dimorphism may manifest itself in differences in
   volume, a male's size being only about 62-70% of that of the female's,
   but formerly assumed deviations in shape could not be proved to be of
   significance for species of Helicina. A certain value for the degree of
   differences in uncovering systematic affinities is indicated.

AB The diverse fauna and flora of rocky intertidal ecosystems are being
   impacted by the activities of rapidly increasing coastal populations in
   many regions of the world. Human harvesting of intertidal species can
   lead to significant changes in body sizes of these taxa. However, little
   is known about the temporal trajectories of such size declines and more
   importantly, the long-term effects of chronic human impacts.
   Furthermore, it is unclear whether sizes of species not directly
   targeted for harvesting are also declining through indirect effects.
   Here we use historical (extending back to 1869) and field survey data
   covering 200 km of mainland southern California coast to show that human
   activities have led to significant and widespread declines in body sizes
   of rocky intertidal gastropod species over the last century. These
   declines, initiated several decades ago, are continuing and contrary to
   expectation, they are not restricted to species harvested for human
   consumption. Data from the only national park in this area, where
   conservation laws are strictly imposed, demonstrate that negative
   ecological impacts can be ameliorated if existing laws are enforced.

AB Despite considerable progress in the study of inducible defenses, our
   understanding of the role of cues and costs to their ecology and
   evolution remains limited. This study, focused on inducible defenses in
   the intertidal snail, Littorina obtusata, in response to the invasive
   green crab, Carcinus maenas, in the Gulf of Maine. We used widely
   separated (similar to400 km) snail populations from northern Maine and
   Massachusetts because they differ in their extent of historical and
   present-day contact with C. maenas. Crabs are presently more abundant in
   the southern Gulf and have been there for twice as long (similar to100
   yr). We examined whether these geographic differences in contact history
   and abundance may contribute to geographic differences in risk cue
   sensitivity, the amount of induced defense, and the scaling of
   trade-offs accompanying the induced defense,
   Risk cues from both crabs and damaged conspecifics induced the greatest
   increases in snail shell thickness, whereas exposure to just crab cues
   induced intermediate levels of thickening. Interestingly, our results
   suggest that the effects of risk cues are additive and that geographic
   differentiation in cue sensitivity only occurs in response to crab cues.
   While northern snails showed greater shell thickness plasticity in
   response to crab cues, there was no geographic differentiation in
   sensitivity to cues from damaged conspecifics. We also found that the
   scaling of trade-offs in body size vs. shell thickness was similar for
   both regions. This result contrasts with theory because one would expect
   the more intense selection regime caused by increased crab predation in
   the southern Gulf to diminish the impact of trade-offs on southern
   snails. However, this result is consistent with the hypotheses that (1)
   trade-offs in body size are likely mediated by architectural constraints
   imposed by the shell and (2) circumventing these constraints via changes
   in shell shape would likely result in a shell that is more vulnerable to
   crab predation. Analysis of aperture area and spire height for field
   populations revealed no geographic differentiation in aperture area, but
   taller spires in northern snails. Hence, more intense selection via crab
   predation in the southern Gulf may prevent changes in shell shape that
   reduce the impact of trade-offs. Finally, despite the large trade-offs
   accompanying increases in shell thickness, our study suggests that the
   functional value of increased shell strength in reducing vulnerability
   to crab predation outweighs these costs.

AB Over the last three decades, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis has invaded rocky shores on the west coast of southern
   Africa, and now makes up 74 % of intertidal mussel biomass. It competes
   directly with an abundant indigenous limpet, Scutellastra argenvillei,
   which attains high densities and biomass due to collective feeding on
   kelp. This competition has reduced the limpet's access to kelp, and
   dense aggregations of the limpets are now found only in small patches
   (termed 'established patches') that are remnants of the previous limpet
   belt. Lower densities of the limpets occur on mussel beds or in patches
   cleared of mussels by wave action ('cleared patches'). We investigated
   the effects of Mytilus encroachment on the movement patterns of S.
   argenvillei by comparing its homing and movements in these 3 situations.
   Short-term (12 h) homing frequency was similar on established patches
   (86.5 %) and newly created cleared patches (81.3 %) but significantly
   less on the mussel bed (60.4 %). On a monthly basis, homing frequency
   was lower, but significantly different in all 3 habitats (51.0, 29.2 and
   10.9 %, respectively). Distances moved did not differ between habitats
   during the 12 h observations, but on a monthly basis were significantly
   greater on the mussel bed than in the other 2 habitats. There were no
   significant differences between the distances moved by juveniles versus
   adults for either 12 h or 1 mo periods. Small limpets on mussel beds
   frequently moved into cleared patches (29.8 %) while other limpets
   virtually never changed habitats. Mytilus encroachment has thus
   increased the mobility and reduced the homing frequency of S.
   argenvillei, probably because it limits access to kelp and increases
   dependency on alternative food sources. These changes in behaviour are
   associated with radical reductions' of the density and mean size of S.
   argenvillei in areas dominated by M galloprovincialis. Individuals that
   survive on the secondary substratum provided by mussels are all small
   and sexually immature. M galloprovincialis has thus had an impact on

AB The South African abalone, Haliotis midae, fishery is now 50 years old.
   The commercial sector has recently been consolidated into one category
   "rights holders," who may both dive and market their catch. A new
   overall total allowable catch (TAC) of 820 t (whole mass in shell) has
   been initiated. This includes a commercial TAC of 523 t, a new
   "subsistence" TAC of 138.5 t, and a recreational TAC of 158.5 t.
   Poaching is a major problem with a high proportion of sublegal-sized
   abalone being taken. This has resulted in serial reductions in TAC in
   one zone from 150 to 15 t. Intensive fishery-independent diving surveys
   are underway. Co-management and ranching pilot projects have been
   initiated. Movement of rock lobster, Jasus lalandii, into two of the
   major TAC zones has interrupted the normal recruitment cycle of H. midae
   due to lobster predation on sea urchins, Parechinus angulosus, which
   juvenile abalone depend on for protection. Due to the combined effect of
   poaching and ecological changes, the prognosis for the resource is now
   poor, with future reductions in TAC likely.

AB Patterns of change in shell width over a period of 35,000 years are
   documented in three fossil land snail species, Euhadra pachya (Pilsbry,
   Phaeohelix phaeogramma (Ancey), and Coniglobus mercatorius daemonorus
   (Pilsbry) on the island of Kikai in the Ryu-kyu Islands of the southwest
   part of Japan. The shell width of these species fluctuated through time,
   and the patterns were mostly synchronized among the three species. The
   temporal variations in shell width among fossil populations were far
   larger than geographical variations in shell width among modem
   populations. Since Kikai Island has been isolated from the other islands
   in the region, these morphological changes are regarded as genuine
   changes that have occurred within the island. The temporal changes in
   width were accompanied by distinct changes in spire indexj
   (height/width) within a single species. The patterns of change in width
   are correlated with the pattern of change in the climate since 35 Ka
   (35,000 years ago).

AB Littorina striata is a strictly Macaronesian, intertidal periwinkle with
   planktonic development. The species produces both nodulose and smooth
   shells, which co-occur at Ilheu de Vila Franca do Campo, a drowned
   crater situated about 1000 m off the south coast of Sao Miguel, Azores.
   The present work describes and analyzes the shell variation, temporal
   change and ecological distribution of the two shell types at this crater
   over a 3-year period. Nodulose shells were more common in the sheltered
   lagoon inside the crater, while smooth specimens dominated the outside
   of the wave-exposed crater. Moreover, nodulose specimens were smaller
   and weighed less compared to smooth ones. However, regardless of
   morphotype, shells from the lagoon had a smaller aperture and were less
   globose than those from the outside. Within an exposure regime, smooth
   specimens had a larger aperture. These patterns remained constant over
   time. They are tentatively interpreted as functional adaptations to
   thermal stress and wave exposure. The mechanisms that maintain these
   patterns are still unknown. Yet, aperture height of specimens
   transplanted from the lagoon to the outside increased markedly over a
   period of 5 months, whereas no comparable changes were observed in other
   experimental groups (i.e. transplanted from the outside into gr the
   lagoon, transplanted within the outside and transplanted within the
   lagoon; the latter two transplant groups being the blancos). This
   suggests that at least the aperture size in L. striata may be an
   ecophenotypically plastic trait.

AB Year-to-year changes in age structure, biomass (B), annual secondary
   production (P) and P/(B) over bar ratio are described of a population of
   the subtidal snail Umbonium costatum in Hakodate Bay, northern Japan,
   during a 6-y period (1982-1988). Population structure and values of
   biomass and production were highly variable from year to year; the
   ranges of the annual mean biomass, annual production and PIE ratio were
   3.71-9.22 g dry tissue m(-2), 1.01-4.92 g dry tissue m(-2) y(-1) and
   0.13-1.33 y(-1), respectively. Change in the age structure was the most
   important single factor affecting temporal changes in annual production
   in this population. The annual production of the population was high
   when young individuals, which have a small body size and high growth
   rate, dominated the population. While annual P/(B) over bar ratios in
   1983 and 1984 fell within the range of values reported for various other
   gastropods, those in 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 were markedly lower, if
   the relation between the population P/(B) over bar ratio and life span
   is taken into account. This demonstrates that production estimates from
   annual biomass and life-span values may lead to incorrect results in a
   recruitment-limited population.
