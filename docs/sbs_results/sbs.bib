  Abstract                 = {A recently documented correlate of anthropogenic climate change involves reductions in body size, the nature and scale of the pattern leading to suggestions of a third universal response to climate warming. Because body size affects thermoregulation and energetics, changing body size has implications for resilience in the face of climate change. A review of recent studies shows heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of size responses, exposing a need for large-scale phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses of temporal size change. Integrative analyses of museum data combined with new theoretical models of size-dependent thermoregulatory and metabolic responses will increase both understanding of the underlying mechanisms and physiological consequences of size shifts and, therefore, the ability to predict the sensitivities of species to climate change.},

The objective of the study was to assess the impact of introduced planktivorous whitefish Coregonus lavaretus s.1. on zooplankton, especially on the main prey species Bosmina coregoni Baird s.str.2. A size-frequency analysis of carapace remains preserved in the sediments clearly shows a size shift in a Bosmina coregoni population. The carapace length of B. coregoni decreased by 11.0% after the introduction of the size-selective planktivorous whitefish, indicating a parallel body-size reduction.3.During the study period no changes could be found in the carapace length of Chydorus sphaericus O. F. Müller, which was not preyed upon.},
