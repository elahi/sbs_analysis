Methods of summarising and analysing temperature data
------------------------------------------------------

## Intertidal rock temperatures - empirical logger data

Measurements: iButton thermochron temperature loggers
Duration: August 1 2015 - September 12 2015
Frequency: every 15 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean of daily max, median, minimum for entire 6 week period for each logger position

## Intertidal body temperatures - predictions from heat budget model

Measurements: Luke Miller's heat budget model (takes into account air temperature, irradiance, wind speed...)
Duration: August 1 1999 - August 1 2013
Frequency: every 10 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean daily max, median, minimum for each month for each position

## Sea surface temperatures - Hopkins Marine Station

Measurements: mercury thermometer
Duration: January 1 1919 - July 31 2016
Frequency: daily (usually in the morning)

Summarising steps
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum temperature for each month

## Air temperatures - Monterey NCDC

Measurements: mercury thermometer (?)
Duration: January 1 1951 - August 7 2016
Frequency: daily maximum, daily minimum, and daily observed (only through 2010)

Summarising steps
  1. Get maximum of daily maximum for each month
  2. Get median of daily observed temperature for each month
  3. Get minimum of daily minimum for each month
