Methods of summarising and analysing temperature data
------------------------------------------------------

## Intertidal rock temperatures - empirical logger data

Measurements: iButton thermochron temperature loggers
Duration: August 1 2015 - September 12 2015
Frequency: every 15 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean of daily max, median, minimum for entire 6 week period for each logger position

## Intertidal body temperatures - predictions from heat budget model

Measurements: Luke Miller's heat budget model (takes into account air temperature, irradiance, wind speed...)
Duration: August 1 1999 - August 1 2013
Frequency: every 10 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean daily max, median, minimum for each month for each position

## Sea surface temperatures - Hopkins Marine Station

Measurements: mercury thermometer
Duration: January 1 1937 - Dec 31 2015
Frequency: daily (usually in the morning)

Summarising steps
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum temperature for each month
  2. Calculate annual means:
    * maximum = mean of the monthly maximum for three hottest months (july, aug, sept)
    * minimum = mean of the monthly minimum for three coldest months (dec, jan, feb)
    * median = mean of the monthly median for all 12 months

## Air temperatures - Monterey NCDC

Measurements: mercury thermometer (?)
Duration: January 1 1951 - Dec 31 2015
Frequency: daily maximum, daily minimum, and daily observed (only through 2010)

Summarising steps
  1. Calculate annual means:
    * maximum = mean of the daily maximum for three hottest months (aug, sept, oct)
    * minimum = mean of the daily minimum for three coldest months (dec, jan, feb)
    * 'median' = mean of the daily observed temperature for all 12 months
