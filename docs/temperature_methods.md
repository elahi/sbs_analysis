Methods of summarising and analysing temperature data
------------------------------------------------------

## Intertidal rock temperatures - empirical logger data

Measurements: iButton thermochron temperature loggers
Duration: August 1 2015 - September 12 2015
Frequency: every 15 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean of daily max, median, minimum for entire 6 week period for each logger position

## Intertidal body temperatures - predictions from heat budget model

Measurements: Luke Miller's heat budget model (takes into account air temperature, irradiance, wind speed...)
Duration: August 1 1999 - August 1 2013
Frequency: every 10 minutes

Summarising steps:
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum for each day
  2. Calculate mean daily max, median, minimum for each month for each position

This summary was then used to:
  1. Extract the single hottest, median, and coldest month for each run across the 15 year period (used for rock and body temperature figure)
  2. Calculate the mean annual max, median, min for each year (not used)
  3. Calculate summer max, winter min, and median (used for temperature time series figure):
    * summer max = mean of the monthly maximum for July, Aug, Sept
    * winter min = mean of the monthly minimum for Dec - Feb
    * annual median = mean of the monthly median for the whole year

## Sea surface temperatures - Hopkins Marine Station

Measurements: mercury thermometer
Duration: January 1 1937 - Dec 31 2015
Frequency: daily (usually in the morning)

Summarising steps
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum temperature for each month
  2. Calculate annual means:
    * summer max = mean of the monthly maximum for three hottest months (july, aug, sept)
    * winter min = mean of the monthly minimum for three coldest months (dec, jan, feb)
    * median = mean of the monthly median for all 12 months

## Air temperatures - Monterey NCDC

Measurements: mercury thermometer (?)
Duration: January 1 1951 - Dec 31 2015
Frequency: daily maximum, daily minimum, and daily observed (only through 2010)

Summarising steps
  1. Get maximum, median, minimum temperature for each month
  2. Calculate annual means:
    * summer max = mean of the daily maximum for three hottest months (aug, sept, oct)
    * winter min = mean of the daily minimum for three coldest months (dec, jan, feb)
    * annual median = mean of the daily median observed temperature for all 12 months
