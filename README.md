Shrinking body size project 
----------------------------

### gastropods at Hopkins Marine Station

Question: have intertidal gastropods decreased in body size over the past 5-6 decades?  
Approach: searched student papers at Hopkins Miller Library for historical size-frequency data on gastropods.
Extracted papers with appropriate data, reasonable replication, and adequate site descriptions for relocation. 

Littorina keenae - 1947, by Childs  
Lottia digitalis - 1950, by Hexter  
Tegula funebralis - 1962, by Wara  

Then we relocated sites and collected size-frequency data in 2014-2015.  

####  Next steps

1. Waiting on Chris Patton - air temperatures
2. Fix tidal heights for Littorina
  - Mark's pvc markers at high rock will be between 1.6 and 1.7 above MLLW because they started drifting upwards from the original 1.5m target at that end of his transect
  - I need a transparent, clean workflow for the decision steps
  - apply to size data, logger data, and hindcast data
3. Denote crack vs face for logger temps
4. Temperature hindcasts - pull hottest month for max, pull coldest month for min
5. Deal with hindcast facet labels
6. Compare submersion time across tidal height range for all three species
