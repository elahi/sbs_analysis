Shrinking body size project 
----------------------------

### gastropods at Hopkins Marine Station

Question: have intertidal gastropods decreased in body size over the past 5-6 decades?  
Approach: searched student papers at Hopkins Miller Library for historical size-frequency data on gastropods.
Extracted papers with appropriate data, reasonable replication, and adequate site descriptions for relocation. 

Littorina keenae - 1947, by Childs  
Lottia digitalis - 1950, by Hexter  
Tegula funebralis - 1962, by Wara  

Then we relocated sites and collected size-frequency data in 2014-2015.  


####  Next steps

0. Analyze physical data
    - sea level
    - enso (MEI)
    - pdo
    - weather (monterey and pg)
        * air temperature
        * precipitation
        * fog (?)
        

1. Plot snail body size (mean, max, cv) against habitat temperature (mean, max, range) for modern data
    - need to decide which snail samples relate to which loggers (most difficult for Chlorostoma)
    - use leaflet, do this by eye?
    
2. Plot size change/time against habitat thermal variability (predict positive relationship - such that higher thermal variability results in larger body size, especially maximum body size)

3. Get satellite air temperature time-series for Pacific Grove and other studies

4. Other potential studies to follow up on:
    - Frank - Tegula
    - Paine - Tegula
    - Littorina in san diego

5. Experiment?
