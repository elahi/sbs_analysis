Shrinking body size project 
----------------------------

### gastropods at Hopkins Marine Station

Question: have intertidal gastropods decreased in body size over the past 5-6 decades?  
Approach: searched student papers at Hopkins Miller Library for historical size-frequency data on gastropods.
Extracted papers with appropriate data, reasonable replication, and adequate site descriptions for relocation. 

Littorina keenae - 1947, by Childs  
Lottia digitalis - 1950, by Hexter  
Tegula funebralis - 1962, by Wara  

Then we relocated sites and collected size-frequency data in 2014-2015.  

####  Next steps

5. 2 panel plot of temperature time-series
6. Compare submersion time across tidal height range for all three species

#### Other observational studies to follow up on:
