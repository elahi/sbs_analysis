Shrinking body size project - gastropods at Hopkins Marine Station

Principle collaborators: Will Sano

Question: have intertidal gastropods decreased in body size over the past 5-6 decades?  
Approach: searched student papers at Hopkins Miller Library for historical size-frequency data on gastropods.   
Extracted papers with appropriate data, reasonable replication, and adequate site descriptions for relocation. 


Littorina keenae - 1947, by Childs  
Lottia digitalis - 1950, by Hexter  
Tegula funebralis - 1962, by Wara  

Then we relocated sites and collected size-frequency data in 2014-2015.
