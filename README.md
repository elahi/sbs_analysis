Shrinking body size project 
----------------------------

### gastropods at Hopkins Marine Station

Question: have intertidal gastropods decreased in body size over the past 5-6 decades?  
Approach: searched student papers at Hopkins Miller Library for historical size-frequency data on gastropods.
Extracted papers with appropriate data, reasonable replication, and adequate site descriptions for relocation. 

Littorina keenae - 1947, by Childs  
Lottia digitalis - 1950, by Hexter  
Tegula funebralis - 1962, by Wara  

Then we relocated sites and collected size-frequency data in 2014-2015.  


####  Next steps

1. Plot snail body size (mean, max, cv) against habitat temperature (mean, max, range) for modern data
    - need to decide which snail samples relate to which loggers (most difficult for Chlorostoma)
    
2. Plot size change/time against habitat thermal variability (predict positive relationship - such that higher thermal variability results in larger body size, especially maximum body size)

3. Get satellite air temperature time-series for Pacific Grove and other studies


### Meta-analysis of body-size reductions

Extract body size rate of change (delta size/delta time), relate to warming velocity and other covariates (e.g., human harvesting). 

Get climate velocity for air temperature

Fish data? E.g., SBC, Channel Islands

#### Next steps

1. Decided on effect size, prelim comparison
    - log ratio
    - % change per year
    - % change per degree C 
2. Implement WOS search in metagear or other
